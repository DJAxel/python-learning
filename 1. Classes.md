# Classes

Classes are blueprints for instances of an object. Under the hoof, a class is also an object op the type `type`.

Classes come with state (data) and behaviour (methods). Even an empty class like below has a state and behaviour. It has a `Person.__name__` attribute and an `Person.__init__()` method for instance.

```python
class Person:
  pass
```

The type of an object can be found by using `type(object)` or `object.__class__`. To check wether an object is of a certain type, use `isinstance(object, Person)`.

## Class attributes

(not instance attributes) can defined on the class definition like so:
  
```python
class MyClass:
  attribute_name="value"
  temperature=26
```

To **retrieve** an attribute from a class: `getattr(MyClass, 'temperature')`. Optionally a default value can be passed as a third parameter.

The **dot notation** is a more common way to access class attributes: `MyClass.temperature`. No default can be passed here and an `AttributeError` is raised when the attribute does not exist.

To **set** an attribute on a class: `setattr(MyClass, 'temperature', 27)`. The dot notation works here as well: `MyClass.temperature = 27`.

Attributes can be added on the fly to a class, even if it did not exist before: `MyClass.new_attribute = "new value"`.

To **remove** an attribute, use the `delattr(MyClass, 'temperature')` method or `del MyClass.temperature`.

Under the hoof, python saves most of its class state in a `dict` called `__dict__`. This is a dictionary with key-value pairs of all attributes and their values. This dictionary can be accessed directly: `MyClass.__dict__`. This dict cannot be modified directly, but can be modified using the `setattr()` function.

### Methods are attributes

Methods of a class are also attributes, but of type `function`. Calling class methods is technically also possible using MyClass.__dict__['method_name']() and `getattr(MyClass, 'method_name')()`, but the dot notation `MyClass.method_name()` is common practice.

## Instances

By calling a class as a function, an instance of that class is created and returned. Every instance has it's own namespace and state, distinct from other instances and the class.

It is safer to call `type(instance)` to check the type of an instance, because `__class__` is just an attribute of the class or instance and can be overwritten.

## Data attributes

In the following code, an attribute is set on the class and an instance of that class is created. When accessing the attribute of on instance, it will look in the `__dict__` of the instance first and return the value if present. In this case however, it will not find it there (because the attribute was set on the class) and look higher up the chain in the `__dict__` of the class and return it from there.

```python
class MyClass:
  language: 'Python'

instance = MyClass()

instance.language  # Returns 'Python' from the `MyClass.__dict__`
```

Modifyig the attributes of a class will affect all instances of that class, even if it already exists.

```python
class MyClass:
  language: 'Python'

instance = MyClass()

MyClass.language = 'Java'

instance.language  # Returns 'Java'
```

Conrary to a class, an instances `__dict__` is mutable:

```python
class MyClass:
  pass

instance = MyClass()
instance.__dict__['version'] = '1.0'
instance.version  # Returns '1.0'
```


## Function attributes

A class can have functions as attributes. WHenever an instance of a class is made, these functions are transformed to **bound methods**. When calling a bound method, the instance is passed as the first argument to the function. This is why the first argument of a method is always `self` (although it can be named diferently).

```python
class MyClass:
  version = '1.0'

  def my_method(self):
    print(self.version)

instance = MyClass()
instance.my_method()  # Prints '1.0'
```

## Initializing

Whenever an instance is created, the `__init__()` method is called. This method is used to initialize the instance with data. The instance has already been created however. It is therefore a bound method which takes the instance as the first argument.

Any properties that are set in the `__init__()` method are instance attributes. They are not shared between instances.


## Assigning methods to specific instances

Methods can be created and bound to specific instances by using the `types.MethodType()` function and bind its outcome as an attribute on the instance.

```python
from types import MethodType

class Person:
  def __init__(self, name):
    self.name = name

p1 = Person('Eric')

p1.say_hello = MethodType(lambda self: f'{self.name} says hello', p1)
```


## Properties

Most languages have the concept of private and public. In Java for instance, properties of a class are often made private and getter and setter methods are used to set and access the value of the property. Python does not have the concept of private attributes or methods however. The convention is that attributes and methods that start with an underscore are private and should not be accessed directly. Python does not prevent you from doing so however.

Python does support properties however. This way, the interface of a class stays the same if functionality should be added in a getter or setter later on. A property is defined like below:

```python
class MyClass:
  def get_language(self):
    return self._language
  
  def set_language(self, value):
    self._language = value

  language = property(fget=get_language, fset=set_language)
```

When the `language` property of `MyClass` is now accessed using `MyClass.language`, the `get_language()` method is called. When the `language` property is set using `MyClass.language = value`, the `set_language(value)` method is called.

The `property` class also has a `fdel` parameter to define a method that is called when the property is deleted using `del MyClass.language`, and a `doc` parameter to define the docstring of the property.

It's more readable to use a decorator for this:

```python
class MyClass:
  @property
  def language(self):
    return self._language
  
  @language.setter
  def language(self, value):
    self._language = value

  @language.deleter
  def language(self):
    del self._language
```


## Calculated properties

A calculated property is really only a read-only property (getter only) that calculates its return value based on other variables (none are passed into the getter).

For better efficiency, it's good to do a lazy calculation (calculate only as soon as the calculated property is accessed), but also to cache the result at that point, so that the calculation does not have to be done again. If one of the variables the calculation depends on changes, the cache should be invalidated.

```python
class Circle:
  def __init__(self, radius):
    self._radius = radius
    self._area = None

  @property
  def area(self):
    if self._area is None:
      self._area = 3.14 * (self.radius ** 2)
    return self._area
  
  @property radius(self):
    return self._radius
  
  @radius.setter
  def radius(self, value):
    if value < 0:
      raise ValueError('Radius cannot be negative')
    self._radius = value
    self._area = None
```


## Class methods

A normal function defined in a class will be a regular funtion when called from the class and an (automatically) bound method to any instance. A bound instance method needs to take the instance as a first parameter (`self`) to be called from the instance.

It is also possible to define a class method using the `@classmethod` decorator. Such a method is bound to the class both from the class as from any instance of that class. It takes the class as the first parameter (`cls`) instead of the instance.

```python
class MyClass:
  @classmethod
  def my_class_method(cls):
    print(cls)
```


## Static methods

A static method is a method that is not bound to anything, nether the class nor any instance. These methods are decorated with `@staticmethod`.

```python
class MyClass:
  @staticmethod
  def print_hello():
    print('Hello')
```


## Class body scope

Within a class, other class variables can be referenced because they are in the same scope:

```python
class MyClass:
  FIRST = 2
  SECOND = 3
  THIRD = FIRST + SECOND  # 5
```

Functions within a class are scoped on the module level however, so outside the class scope. This means that they cannot reference class variables without the use of `self` or `MyClass`:

The example below demonstrates how a nested function in a class in a function behaves:

```python
MAJOR = 1
MINOR = 2
REVISION = 3

def gen_class():
    MAJOR = 4
    MINOR = 5
    REVISION = 6

  class Language:
    MAJOR = 7
    MINOR = 8
    REVISION = 9

    @classmethod
    def version(cls):
      return f'{MAJOR}.{MINOR}.{REVISION}'
    
  return Language

gen_class().version()  # Returns '4.5.6'
```

Calling the `version()` method of the `Language` class returns `4.5.6` because the `version()` method resides in the `gen_class()` scope. If `MAJOR`, `MINOR` and `REVISION` were not defined in that function, the `version()` method would have returned `1.2.3` because it would have used the global variables.

The example below demonstrates that list comprehensions, which are also functions, are therefore also scoped on the module level:

```python
name = 'Guido'

class MyClass:
  name = 'Eric'
  list_1 = [name] * 3  # ['Eric', 'Eric', 'Eric']
  list_2 = [name for i in range(3)]  # ['Guido', 'Guido', 'Guido']
```
